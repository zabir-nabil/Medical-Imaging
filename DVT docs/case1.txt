A 70-year-old man with right lower limb swelling for 7 days who was examined with combined CTV. Cross-sectional images show “filling defect” sign (white arrow) in the proximal (A) and distal (B) femoral vein, indicating acute thrombosis. Note the left lower limb deep veins that are simultaneously revealed. The degree of enhancement of a true thrombus was less than that of the opposite vein on the same level. An image obtained with curved planar reconstruction (C) shows extensive thrombosis in the femoral and popliteal veins (white arrows). Images reconstructed with maximum intensity projection (D) and volume rendering (E) show the vessel tree of the right limb. The contrast medium was mainly flowing through the right great saphenous vein (GSV) and the right common iliac vein (RCIV). Ascending venography (F, G) shows that the superficial femoral vein is not visible, indicating thrombotic occlusion.
